## Note for Prof. Spehr

*First of all I would like to thank Prof. Spehr for the help and consultations throughout the semester and the project.*

I updated my requirements.txt and .gitignore file as like the email you mention. I deleted my folder and clone and restart the project as the 4 steps in "getting started". It works on my PC. I hope it will works in yours, too.  
If it is not working please sent me a mail, so we can look up the problem again
