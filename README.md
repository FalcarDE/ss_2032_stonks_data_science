## Note for Prof. Spehr

*First of all I would like to thank Prof. Spehr for the help and consultations throughout the semester and the project.*

I updated my requirements.txt and .gitignore file as you mentioned in the Email. I deleted my folder, clone and restart the project with the 5 steps in "getting started". It works on my PC. I hope it will work on your machine, too. 
If it is not working please sent me a mail, so we can look up the problem again.
